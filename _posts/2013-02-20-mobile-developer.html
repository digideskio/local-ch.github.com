        </h1>
        <p>
            Are you:
            <ol type="a">
                <li>An experienced mobile guru?</li>
                <li>Passionate about mobile development and eager to learn the ropes?
            </ol>
        <p>
            As a mobile web engineer you will focus on enriching and creating a great user experience on local.ch's "native" apps — with over 2 million downloads on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id300110733?mt=8">iOS</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.local.android">Android</a> and other platforms — and <a href="http://i.local.ch">mobile web applications</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            We base our mobile web development on the newest JavaScript mobile frameworks and combine a mix of agile practices, pair programming and code reviews to improve the process of working in a team. We take testing and automation seriously. As a small team, we believe we have constructed an environment that allows us to continue to adapt and develop cutting edge features.
        </p>
        <p>On iOS, Android and other platforms such as Windows Phone, we have our <a href="http://webmemo.ch/mobile/case-study-native-apps-vikram-kriplaney-local-ch">reasons</a> for going fully native.</p>
        <p>
            Your responsibility is end-to-end, from planning, implementation, testing to maintaining your code after deployment. You are part of a solid team of engineers, working with product owners, specialists and other teams. New features are implemented and deployed in short iterations and your contributions and ideas are always welcome (and we love <a href="https://github.com/harryf/thoughts/blob/master/mobile-killed-the-login.md">crazy ideas</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
            And because we're running some of the most popular mobile applications in Switzerland, you get a chance to have a positive impact on millions of users right from your first day.
