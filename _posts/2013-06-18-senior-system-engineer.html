    <h1>Senior System Engineer</h1>

    <p>Our software engineers develop new features. On site. Agile. Using Ruby on Rails/Java/PHP. They like to deploy their new features and services often. System Engineering works closely together with Software Engineering helping to build a fresh and reliable website.</p>

    <p>Our system serves 4.3 million unique clients a month, making us the biggest national Swiss website. We're also proud of our uptime. To achieve this we have a high level of redundancy (2 data centers, load balancing) and a devops culture where Software and System Engineers help out keeping our services up.</p>

    <p>System engineering involves building and operating the hardware, software and network that runs our site.</p>

    <p>In our team of 3 system engineers you would:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>plan, develop and deploy hardware and systems according to technical requirements</li>
        <li>simplify, consolidate and document complex systems</li>
        <li>create puppet recipes for the automated configuration of 160 servers (~100 hardware, rest VMs)</li>
        <li>solve technical problems, find and fix root issues</li>
        <li>develop and improve our infrastructure so it enables us to rollout new features quickly.</li>
        <li>effectively ensure a high uptime of old and new systems</li>
        <li>plan fallback scenarios in case of major outages (restore of backups, rollbacks)</li>
      </ul>
    <p>
      You need to have completed either a Fach- or a Hochschulstudium and speak and write English fluently, German is a nice to have.<br />
      You should have these experiences:
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li>linux system engineering (Debian, CentOS/RH)</li>
        <li>network experience (routing, firewalls, vlan, dns)</li>
        <li>virtualisation, ideally KVM</li>
        <li>project planning, able to prioritise project work against operations work</li>
        <li>setting up/inspecting ruby and java environments (e.g. unicorn, tomcat)</li>
        <li>MongoDB: inspect, optimize, monitor, backup</li>
        <li>load-balancing and failover strategies</li>
        <li>writing of script languages (Shell, Ruby or Python or all three or more)</li>
        <li>code management tools (git, subversion)</li>
        <li>automation and measuring (Puppet/cdist, Nagios/Icinga, Graphite/Statsd, Splunk)</li>
        <li>Backup &amp; Restore (ccollect)</li>
        <li>Storage handling (NFS)</li>
      </ul>

    <p>We offer you an environment where you can bring in your experience and know-how. As you see we enjoy using modern, agile technologies. Our flat hierarchy enables you to work you with a high degree of freedom and responsibility.</p>
