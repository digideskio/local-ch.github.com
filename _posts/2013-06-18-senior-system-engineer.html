    <h1>Senior System Engineer</h1>

    <p>Our software engineers develop new features. On site. Agile. Using Ruby on Rails/Java/PHP. They like to deploy their new features and services often. System Engineering works closely together with Software Engineering helping to build a fresh and reliable website.</p>

    <p>Our system serves 4.3 million unique clients a month, making us the biggest national Swiss website. We're also proud of our uptime. To achieve this we have a high level of redundancy (2 data centers, load balancing) and a devops culture where Software and System Engineers help out keeping our services up.</p>

    <p>System engineering involves building and operating the hardware, software and network that runs our site.</p>

        <li>create puppet recipes for the automated configuration of 160 servers (~100 hardware, rest VMs)</li>
        <li>solve technical problems, find and fix root issues</li>
        <li>develop and improve our infrastructure so it enables us to rollout new features quickly.</li>
        <li>effectively ensure a high uptime of old and new systems</li>
